1. OVERVIEW

   This application is a set of API unit tests for libtle_dring, libtle_l4p,
   and libtle_timer libraries, plus a small set of functional tests for RX/TX 
   functions in libtle_l4p library.

   UT application needs GoogleTest C++ testing framework to compile, please
   follow installation steps below to enable them.

2. INSTALLATION GUIDE

   Assumes that user had finished initial installation from TLDK root
   directory README.

   1) TLDK unit tests require pcap PMD to be available, enable it in DPDK and
        rebuild it. (http://dpdk.org/doc/quick-start has information how to
        do it)
   2) Obtain GoogleTest and build it. Some additional dependencies might be
      needed. (refer to https://github.com/google/googletest for information
      how to download and build it)
   3) Make sure that GTEST_DIR and GMOCK_DIR environment variables are set.
   4) Rebuild TLDK.

2.1 Example

   cd dpdk
   make config T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
   sed -ri 's,(PMD_PCAP=).*,\1y,' build/.config
   make install

   git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
   cd ../googletest
   export GTEST_DIR=`pwd`/googletest
   export GMOCK_DIR=`pwd`/googlemock
   cmake CMakeLists.txt
   make

   cd ../tldk
   make clean
   make all
   ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/app/gtest-rfc --lcores=0
