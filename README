OVERVIEW
========

TLDK project scope is:
1) Implement a set of libraries for L4 protocol processing (UDP, TCP etc.)
   for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   The goal is to provide lightweight, high performance and highly adaptable
   implementation for L4(UDP, TCP etc.) protocol processing. The provided API
   are not planned to be compatible with BSD socket API. These libraries are
   suppose to be built on top of DPDK.

      Note: these libraries are not supposed to be a 'complete' network stack.

   Implementation of ARP, IP, ETHER, etc layers and related routing tables,
   code for setup, manage and perform actual IO over underlying devices are
   all out of scope of these libraries.

  Implementation of ARP, IP etc. layers and their related routing tables
  are out of scope of these libraries. Similarly, the setup, management and
  actual IO on underlying NIC devices are out of scope too.

   The libraries only need to know about underlying devices plus what
   HW offloads are supported, underlying device MTU and L3/L2 addresses to
   fill into L3/L2 headers for the outgoing packets.

   These libraries should be developed in such manner, they could be used
   independently from implementations of 2) and 3).

2) Create VPP graph nodes, plugins etc using those libraries to implement
   a host stack.

3) Create such mechanisms (netlink agents, packaging, etc) necessary to make
   the resulting host stack easily usable by existing non-vpp aware software.

INSTALLATION GUIDE
=================

1. Obtain latest DPDK.
   (refer to http://dpdk.org for information how to download and build it).
2. Make sure that RTE_SDK and RTE_TARGET DPDK related environment variables
   are setup correctly.
3. Go to the TLDK root directory and type: 'make all'.
4. Run sample applications.

As an example:
export RTE_SDK=/opt/DPDK
export RTE_TARGET=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
cd tldk
make all
./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/app/udpfwd ...
