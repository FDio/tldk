      "message": "not sure this additions to the rte_mbuf is a good idea.\nAs you probably know yourself - such patch will most likely be rejected by dpdk community.\nSo we\u0027ll have to support our own version of rte_mbuf - last thing I want to do.\nIf you really think we need these fileds per packet, then the proper way is to create our own tldk mbuf\nthat would contain rte_mbuf plus some extra metadata (via rte_mbuf priv_size).\nThough I still don\u0027t see why we need that info per packet?\nWhy we can\u0027t store thi sextra info just in tcb?",
